# AI Service Droid
This repo hosts a project in development seeking to use ai technology to create a simple(ish) droid that can measure emotional states in humans

## Current Status:
- Using [MemGPT](https://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT) for the brain
x Using an I2C mic [(setup instructions)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2s-mems-microphone-breakout/raspberry-pi-wiring-test) for an ear (not currently supported)
- Using a [wide angle camera](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5658) for an eye
